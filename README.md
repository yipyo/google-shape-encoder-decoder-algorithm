Algorithm for encoding and decoding Google map shapes. 
============================
Faster and better compression than googles own polygon encoder.
Google only encodes polygons, this encodes all shapes. 


TODO:
 - port it to different lanaguages.  
 - better error checking
 - beta testing for accuracy on global results.
